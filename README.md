Pure Python implementation of the Windows API method [IDvdInfo2::GetDiscID].  
This is a modification of [sjwood's pydvdid](https://github.com/sjwood/pydvdid).

The Windows API method [IDvdInfo2::GetDiscID] is used by Windows Media Center to compute a
'practically unique' 64-bit CRC for metadata retrieval. It's metadata retrieval API has
sadly since shutdown around October 2019 and all it's information is presumably lost.

## Changes compared to sjwood's repo

1. License changed from Apache-2.0 to GPL-3.0.
2. Moved build tools and dependency management from setuptools and requirements.txt to poetry.
3. Support for Python 2.x and Python <3.6 has been dropped. 
4. All tests were removed entirely simply because a lot of the tests would need to be refactored
   for general code changes, and some tests might not be needed anymore.
5. All custom exceptions were removed entirely and replaced with built-in ones.
6. CRC-64 related code were refactored and merged as one CRC64 class in one file.
7. The merged CRC64 class contains various improvements over the original code, including
   improvements with doc-strings, formatting, and such.
8. Various BASH shell scripts and config files were removed entirely as they are deemed unnecessary.

Other than that, the rest of the changes are general code improvements in various ways.
There may be more differences as the repo gets commits, but these are the primary differences from
[sjwood's commit](https://github.com/sjwood/pydvdid/commit/03914fb7e24283c445e5af724f9d919b23caaf95) to
the beginnings of this repository.

## Installation

```shell
$ pip install pydvdid-m
```

## Usage

### CLI

```shell
phoenix@home@~$ dvdid "FAMILY_GUY_VOLUME_11_DISC_1.ISO"
<Disc>
<Name>FAMILY_GUY_VOLUME_11_DISC_1</Name>
<ID>db3804e3|1645f594</ID>
</Disc>
```

You can provide a path to an ISO file, or a mounted device, e.g.:

```shell
phoenix@home@~$ dvdid "/dev/sr0"
<Disc>
<Name>BBCDVD3508</Name>
<ID>3f041dfc|27ffd3a8</ID>
</Disc>
```

or on Windows via Raw Mounted Device:

```shell
PS> dvdid "\\.\E:"
<Disc>
<Name>BBCDVD3508</Name>
<ID>3f041dfc|27ffd3a8</ID>
</Disc>
```

### Package

You can also use pydvdid-m in your own Python code by importing it.  
Here's a couple of things you can do, and remember, you can use both ISO paths and mounted device targets.

```python
>>> from pydvdid_m import DvdId
>>> dvd_id = DvdId(r"C:\Users\John\Videos\FAMILY_GUY_VOLUME_11_DISC_1.ISO")
>>> dvd_id.disc_label
'BBCDVD3508'
>>> repr(dvd_id.checksum)
'<CRC64 polynomial=0x92c64265d32139a4 xor=0xffffffffffffffff checksum=0x3f041dfc27ffd3a8>'
>>> dvd_id.checksum
'3f041dfc|27ffd3a8'
>>> dvd_id.checksum.as_bytes
b"?\x04\x1d\xfc'\xff\xd3\xa8"
>>> dvd_id.dumps()
'<Disc>\n<Name>BBCDVD3508</Name>\n<ID>3f041dfc|27ffd3a8</ID>\n</Disc>'
```
